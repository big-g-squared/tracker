    "We're gonna play around with the approach here. So we have some number $ x $ that represents a timestamp at which a particular kind of unit must be done. Lets say that the unit timestamp is $ a^* $ (some timestamp that we are trying to compute). What requirements should $ a^* $ meet?\n",
    "- Should be before x\n",
    "- Should not interfere with any other activities\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $ A^* = \\{a \\in A | a < x\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the set of all possible solutions to this particular small problem. Now the issue is that there are *many* fixed dates and *many* items to schedule per fixed date. So maybe lets imagine what a vector of timestamps would look like.\n",

    "$$ a^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\text{ s.t. } a_{i}^{*} < x; i = 1,2,...,n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But actually there are greater requirements than that. Each unit takes up a *block* of space so that, in fact, each unit must be time stamped at a time *less than* $ x - b $, where $ b $ is the size of the block for the unit. For now we're gonna assume that each unit has the exact same $ b $ as every other unit. Ok so now we have a rather complicated vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\text{ s.t. } a_{i+1}^* \\geq a_{i}^* + b; a_{n} + b \\leq x; i = 1, 2,...,n, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok but this doesn't take into account the fact that we also have $ x $ to worry about. Not a problem, we can just add $ x $ to the end of the vector and that will ensure that we have the right time. So now what? There have to be a few things that are true about this recursive definition of the vector. So, for example, we can note that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_{i+1}^* - a_{i}^* \\geq b; i = 1, 2, ..., n-1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since b is a known value, we can probably do a matrix operation on the vector and see if the result matches a particular constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix like this should always be solvable, so we can actually create a linear system such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Ta^* \\geq b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then solve for $ a^* $, where $ T $ is the matrix that does all of the proper operations. Now this is the overly simplified case because there are *multiple* fixed objects with *different* time blocks that have their own units that have to be scheduled *before* their particular assigned fixed item. Then there are cases where something needs to be scheduled *after* something as well. So we'll need to consider those cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we could just make b not entirely made up of a single constant. However, how would we make it work for multiple fixed constants? Well I mean, the constants themselves have to be compatible with the other constants, so that wouldn't be much of a problem. So for example, if there are 2 constant events scheduled at an interval $ y $ from each other, we could just add that constraint to the matrix. The question would be whether or not that matrix would be solvable. Now, because each set of units has to be less than a set number, and those numbers are also fixed to be ordered, then we get a perfectly ordered set of elements that will not coincide with each other."

Lets assume that we are using minutes as the numerical units in the system, and that there is a difference of 30 minutes between 2 events, one of which is fixed. There are 1440 minutes in a day, so lets just say that we have a fixed event at 720 minutes (noon) and we have another event about 60 minutes before that.

    "(Now this is where I get kind of mixed up in the proof) In order to arrive to the proposed solution, we must assume the opposite. That is, assume that there exists a solution s.t. you don't have to choose the a's in the way that I've mentioned. (I get lazy here, I'll explain once you read). If we try to minimize the min part of the expression, you are inherently making it impossible the maximize the max part of the expression (thus not maximizing the whole expression). Similarly, if you focus on only maximizing the left side of the expression, then you inherently make it impossible to minimize the right side of the expression (again, thus failing to maximize the entirety of the expression). (And this is where I'm stuck. I know intuitively why this must be the right solution, but I'm just not getting the justification right). Cool thanks for coming to my ted talk."

This doesn't give us any information about how to arrange the middle events. But what kind of information would give us that? Does it even matter? Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions... I got caught up in the math a bit so I think I can just use the pomodoro technique to create the appropriate blocks of time. I also kind of want to vary the kinds of activities and the subject that they're based in. So for example I would have a reading in Stat 134 but a discussion preview in EECS 127 right after that (attempting to do the problems at least before the discussion section in order to have proper context). But for now, in order to get back to the coding of the actual program, I think I'll simply give each event its own spot according to type."
