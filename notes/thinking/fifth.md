## AHHHH

Ok I think I was working on the type of thing that is important.

The thing that is important is the function that runs thru all of the events and puts them in the event objects that I created.

Ok time to learn the thing that makes things easier, which is to learn the arguments for the service.

"Cal's primary football player min is now named max (since they are trans for 10 years now) and they've been single for the entire football event which makes him want to become a truant and orders people to date him and is starting a timer until someone says yes."

A Cal bartender id'd me and let me in despite being in primary school -> My primary timekeeper is a sexy girl named Min that I met on LinkedIn -> The time at which Min wants to get laid is right now -> Now is not the time to be horny said Max, who kept refreshing the link for his cancer test results -> Max got his cancer test results back and he has ten tumors -> The girl went to 10 different singles events and couldn't link up once -> Lucky for the girl, all the singles events were filled with true jackasses -> Two border officers fight each other in front the cartel at gunpoint while chained together a the foot -> A border patrol officer buys a startled time-machine

Ok lets keep going. What's next? Well now the ideal situation would be to look at the math and see what kind of data the math is gonna need. I honestly don't feel like looking at the math right now and I also dont' feel like testing. I think looking at the math is probably better than testing, I'll test when I have a little bit more patience and I'm not freaking out. Hey, future me, please don't me angry at me for not doing more. I seriously feel like I'm going thru something difficult despite not feeling particularly nihilistic. I'll take a look at the math and then I'll hop into some EECS 127. Maybe I'll get some good work done there! Slow progress my dude.
